This project is a simple Task Management service built with GoFiber, a fast web framework for Go, and integrated with a SQLite database for data persistence. The application provides a set of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks. It includes an SQLite database initialization, and the Task entity model captures attributes such as title, description, completion status, and creation timestamps. The RESTful API exposes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. Routes include creating a new task (POST /tasks), retrieving all tasks (GET /tasks), retrieving a specific task by ID (GET /tasks/:id), updating a task (PUT /tasks/:id), and deleting a task (DELETE /tasks/:id). The application is designed to be easily extendable for real-world scenarios, and the provided example demonstrates how to perform basic task management operations through HTTP requests.
